<body class="about">
<h2 id="The_project">The project</h2>
<p>This project was created in October 2018. Before that, there was a project named [OpenQueerMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenQueerMap) but the project is down, as of early 2018. This work is partly based but highly inspired to <a href="https://openlovemap.de">OpenLoveMap</a>, whose aim is to display sex-related content from OpenStreetMap.</p>

<h3 id="How_it_works">How it works</h3>
<p>The map is built upon <a href="https://leafletjs.org">Leaflet</a> and rendered with <a href="https://mapbox.com">Mapbox</a> tiles.</p>

<p>The shown data are taken from <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> project. In particular, search data are taken with <a href="http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap's Nominatim</a> and POI data are taken with <a href="https://overpass-api.de">Overpass</a>.</p>

<p>As of October 2018, the following data are displayed:
<ul>
<li><tt>gay=yes</tt></li>
<li><tt>vending=condom</tt></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="Contribute">Contribute</h3>
The <a href="https://github.com/airon90/GayMap">source code</a> is hosted on GitHub. Feel free to create bug reports, to fork the project or to improve it with pull requests.

If you don't find a place on the map I encourage you to add it on OpenStreetMap, which GayMaps takes data from. You can just leave a note with information, so that other users could improve the map.
